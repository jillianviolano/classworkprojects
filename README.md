# Classwork and Projects!

Just a place where I can compile my projects completed in undergrad at UC Berkeley in different languages, as well as homework assignments and study aids I have created. 

It is organized by **programming language**, to allow access to preferred language quicker. If you would like a specific topic, feel free to look below at what each file contains. It also has the semester and year for context on my educational journey.

Note: voided out material is sensitive information (student ID, etc) or referring to content that is not included. I also go by Jilli, but Jillian is my full legal first name.
